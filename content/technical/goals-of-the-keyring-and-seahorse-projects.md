<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">In an
effort to get better organized, I've put together [a page listing the
goals][] of the [gnome-keyring][] and [seahorse][] projects.Â </span>It's
all broken down into tasks, plans, and what's already done.  
  
The basic jist of it is to make crypto and security a usable experience
on the desktop. This means laying down a foundation for integrating
crypto into applications easily. We have tons of technically excellent
crypto libraries and security components, but there hasn't been the glue
to tie them together and make them usable in apps.   
  
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">It's sort
of like what PackageKit or NetworkManager did for their respective
areas. Linux (and other open source OS's are) really great at
networking, but NetworkManager pulled together all the various bits, and
completed missing parts to make it to be usable.</span>
