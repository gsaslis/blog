Went to FOSDEM last weekend. It was a cool and crazy conference: packed
rooms, great talks, good friends, much beer. I enjoyed finally meeting
the [Collabora][] guys I'm now working with.  

I hung out in the absolutely packed security devroom the first day,
superbly [organized by Martin Paljak from OpenSC][]. Lots of interesting
and insightful talks, and met people that I'd previously only interacted
with online.

Nikos and I both gave talks about using PKCS\#11 as glue to give a
better crypto user experience no matter which crypto library an
application uses. There was a lot of great discussion, ideas and
participation. I'm looking forward to working more folks on this stuff.

[My talk][] discussed [research into trust assertions][], and a new
project called p11-kit. Video [here][].

Part of my work at Collabora has been to make certificates and crypto on
the desktop just work. Stay tuned!
