I've been working on smart card integration into Seahorse, and as part
of that [we need icons for smart cards][]. I had fun putting together
something today:

Obviously not perfect, but I'm happy with the result. The tools and info
in gnome-icon-theme are really nice.  
  
At some point when the illustrious icon designers get a chance, it'd be
cool to have a smart card icon in gnome-icon-theme. I imagine they'd
want to fix it up or replace it. But for now this will live in the gcr
library.  
  
[NLnet][] is sponsoring my employer [Collabora][] to work on basic smart
card viewing and simple management in Seahorse. Shortly I'll be posting
more goodies coming related to this, including stuff that fixes up
Seahorse for casual users as well.
