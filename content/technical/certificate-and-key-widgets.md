Slug: certificate-and-key-widgets

The new certificate and key view widgets are now merged into
gnome-keyring master. They live in [libgcr][]:Â a library for crypto UI
widgets and crypto helpers.  
  
The goal of the widgets are to have a simple mode, where only the
information needed for a user to uniquely identify a certificate is
displayed. The widget can be expanded to show all the details about the
certificate.

Simple mode, with a dialog border.

Details expanded.

At GUADEC [Matthew Paul Thomas][] helped us design a nice certificate
selector, and I'm working on implementing that.
