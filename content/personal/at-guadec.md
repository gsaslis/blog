Yesterday was the first day of my first GUADEC. It was great meeting
many people I've only been in touch with remotely.  
  
We had our Desktop Crypto BOF as well. I imagined it going differently,
and probably should have prepared for it differently. There were topics
that would have been great to discuss but I forgot to bring up:  
  
 * libgcr: the certificate and other crypto widgets and where they'll
live. Should we   
split that out in a separate library.  
 * What to keep/drop from libcryptui.   
 * Our common gsettings schemas for non app specific settings.  
 * Gnome Keyring to do list: [http://live.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring/ToDo](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring/ToDo)
  
But I think there was some solid progress made and really good ideas
came up. Especially the discussion toward the end about how to build the
web of trust more simply.
