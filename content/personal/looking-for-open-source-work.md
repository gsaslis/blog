Well, all good things must come to an end. My [job at The Family
International][] is changing significantly, and I'm looking for other
work. It's been a great organization to work for, I've been able to work
on real interesting and varied projects, and at the same time working to
[support a really worthy cause][].  
  
They've been supportive of my open source work, and have allowed me to
release several internal projects as open source. I managed
singlehandedly to get them on the [short list of top organizations][]
that contributed to GNOME.  
  
But I'm excited about this change. I've applied for positions at a
number of open source companies. I think it'd be awesome working further
with the great folks in the open source community.Â I've had [over 10
years of extensive experience][job at The Family International] to bring
to the table.  
  
My wife, son and I are likely going to move to Germany.
