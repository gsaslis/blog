Really enjoyed the Desktop Summit, and meeting everyone there. The only
bummer part was the network connectivity. My
employer [Collabora][] sponsored my trip and work.  
  
My talk went well ([slides][]), and we had a great time discussing
things afterwards. [LWN wrote an article][] about the talk (the article
will be available for non-subscribers on the 18th of August).  
  
During the BoFs I worked on gnome-keyring integration into the
gnome-shell, as well as fixing bugs in gobject-introspection and
integrating it into gnome-keyring.  
  
Berlin really surprised me. Classier and more alive than I expected.
Classy thunderstorms too. I took a couple hours to ride around on a bike
between rain showers.
