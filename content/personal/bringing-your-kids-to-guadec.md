If you're coming to GUADEC 2016 and bringing your kids along, there's
a handy wiki page where you can look at for tips on what to do while
in Karlsruhe:

If you're coming with small kids, I'll bring along some toys, colors,
and other essentials to the conference. To make that happen, put the age
of your child in the wiki at the link above.
