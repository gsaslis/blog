I'm off the the Desktop Summit shortly. Going to be giving a talk
about [gluing together desktop crypto][] (Oh boy, there's a life size
picture of me at that link. I wonder why it ended up so big? Hrmmmm....)

My first time in Berlin, and it sounds like it'll be fun. Also looking
forward to getting to meet some KDE developers :)
